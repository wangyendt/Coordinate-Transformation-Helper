# Coordinate Transformation Helper
A gui tool to transform coordinate and rotation representation from one coordinate frame to another.

# Usage
"Select the source and target frames by clicking on any of the pre-defined frames, or choose the orientations of the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis individually using the dropdown menus. Be mindful of the quaternion order settings: use w, x, y, z for the Hamilton convention and x, y, z, w for the JPL convention.

Once you've set your preferences, simply click the 'Transform' button to obtain the result. This will display the same rotation as represented in the two different coordinate frames.
